# Svendle
Svendle lets players make their own wordle puzzles using user generation system!

[DEMO](https://exis9.github.io/wordle8/)

Svendle is a full scratch remake version based on [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).
It has some new features like the user generated puzzle and re-editing.

I developed Svendle using [sQuery](https://squery.vercel.app/) and Vue3 Cli.
